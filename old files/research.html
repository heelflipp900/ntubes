      <p align="left"><img width="383" height="153" src="img_res/1T-FET.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" />Our  expertise in phase engineering of TMDs has enabled us to design and test high  performance MoS<span class="style3">2</span> field effect transistors with metallic 1T phase  contacts. Experimental device characteristics of MoS<span class="style3">2</span> transistors  have not yet reached the theoretical predictions, one main reason for that been  the difficulty to make proper metal contacts to MoS<span class="style3">2</span>. In order to  overcome this issue, we d<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a>eveloped our own strategy of  using metallic phase 1T MoS<span class="style3">2</span> at the contacts and using semiconducting  phase 2H MoS<span class="style3">2</span> as the channel layer of the field effect transistor.  Metal deposited on 1T MoS<span class="style3">2</span> has a much lowered Schottky barrier  resulting in efficient injection of charge carriers into the semiconductor.  This tremendous improvement in the performance of MoS<span class="style3">2</span> devices has  encouraged us to use this technique for other TMDs, hence making this strategy  universal (<a href="PDFs/1T-MoS2FET, NatureMater, 2014.pdf">Kappera et al.

    <p><img src="images-main/HER.jpg" width="140" height="138" align="right" />Hydrogen is commonly described as the cleanest fuel ever. 
      However the energy transition towards hydrogen will happen only when hydrogen will be produced at equivalent or lower cost than the other sources of energy. Transition metalchalcogenides (TMDs) are affordable electrocatalyst materials for evolving hydrogen at exceptionally low overpotentials. Moreover recent contributions from our group have revealed the presence of two different phases in chemically exfoliated MoS<span class="style3">2</span>. We are currently investigating the influence of the exfoliation as well as the properties of the different phases towards hydrogen evolution from various TMDs including WS<span class="style3">2</span> and MoS<span class="style3">2</span>. This will give new perspectives for designing improved TMD-based catalyst (<a href="PDFs/WS2HER,NatureMater,2013.pdf" target="_blank">Voiry <em>et al.</em>   Nature Materials (2013)</a>; <a href="PDFs/CondMoS2_NanoLett_2013.pdf" target="_blank">Voiry <em>et al.</em> Nano Lett.

    <p>Analogue to graphene, a single sheet of layered transition  metal dichalcogenides (LTMDs) exhibit intriguing properties arising from their  low dimensionality (<a href="http://nanotubes.rutgers.edu/PDFs/photolumnMoS2.pdf" target="_blank">Eda <em>et al.</em> &quot;Photoluminescence from Chemically Exfoliated MoS2&quot;  Nano Lett. (2011)</a>). Atomically-thin layers of LTMDs can be produced in large  quantities in a form of solution svia appropriate chemical exfoliation process.  We have solution-processed single layer LTMDs to fabricate a novel class of  ultra-thin films which could be useful for wide range of devices such as  photovoltaics, light emitting diodes, and thin film transistors. Our aim is to  explore novel applications of chemically exfoliated LTMDs.</p>

    <p align="left">A single sheet of graphite, or graphene, possesses extremely interesting properties arising from its unique energy dispersion. Graphene can be produced in large quantities and processed in a form of solution once appropriate chemical functionalization is applied. We have solution-processed graphene to fabricate a large area ultra-thin films which could be useful for macro-scale electronic devices such as photovoltaics, sensors, and thin film transistors. One of the major challenges of this work is the complete removal of functional groups from the starting graphene oxide solution (which are initially required for processability) to fully recover the intrinsic properties of graphene. Our aim is to optimize the opto-electronic properties of solution-processed graphene and incorporate it into large area thin film electronics.</p>

    <p align="left">As-synthesized single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are heterogeneous containg metallic or semiconducting SWNTs. Due to averaging effect, when a random network (or thin films) of SWNTs is prepared, the material can behave  as either metallic or semiconducting depending on the network density. SWNT thin films make great transparent conductors when metallic nature of SWNTs is exploited. On the other hand, high performance thin film transistors (TFTs) can be also fabricated from SWNT thin films in which semiconducting nature of SWNTs is utilized. We are currently investigating how the properties of SWNT thin films can be &quot;tuned&quot; for large area opto-electronic applications.</p>

    <p align="left" class="style6">Single walled carbon nanotube scaffolds for bone cell growth</p>
    <p align="left"><img src="images-research/scaffold1.jpg" width="129" height="125" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left" />The long term objective of this in-vitro study is to understand how carbon nanotube substrates affect and control osteoblastic cell behavior. In our wet chemistry laboratory, we prepare single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) thin films that form a scaffold for cell growth. The matrix morphology (roughness and pore size) is easily controllable and thin films can be deposited on a wide range of materials to form a bio-inert coating. This layer can be also functionalized with desired proteins, ligands or calcium related (hydroxyapatite, <span class="style5">a</span>-tricalcium phosphate) formulations. Further evaluations of the engineered matrices take place in collaboration with nearby University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) in the bio-physics laboratory of Prof. Federico Sesti (<a href="http://lifesci.rutgers.edu/~molbiosci/faculty/sesti.html" target="_blank">http://lifesci.rutgers.edu/~molbiosci/faculty/sesti.html</a>). A variety of biochemical, fluorescent microscopy and optical techniques <img src="images-research/scaffold2.jpg" width="179" height="142" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="right" />are commonly applied to record cellular behavior.<br />
      <br />
      We are particularly interested in how the surface morphology of SWNT scaffolds impacts cell proliferation, differentiation, and calcification. Recent survey of the existing knowledge on the osteoblast cells response to carbon nanotubes reveals inconsistency. That is, reported biological studies describe nanotubes either as being toxic (Zhang <em>et al.</em><em> Nanotechnology</em> <strong>18</strong> 475102 (2007)) or enhancing cellular growth (Meng <em>et al</em>.   <em>J Biomed Mater Res Part A</em> 79A 298 (2006)). By systematically studying osteoblastic cell development, we aim to reveal intrinsic interactions influencing tissue histogenesis.</p>

    <p align="left"><img src="images-research/b4c1.jpg" width="139" height="166" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="right" />Boron carbide nanowires are important for their potential use in high performance armor and thermoelectric devices. We are exploring the role of boron/carbon ratio, temperature, inert gas pressure and dopants (Si) on the morphology, length and diameter of nanowires grown using a simple solid-liquid-solid (SLS) growth method. In addition, we are venturing into the growth parameters necessary for the Si doping of boron carbide nanowires which <img src="images-research/b4c2.jpg" width="242" height="139" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left" />results in exotic structures ranging from nanowires and nanobelts to nano-cacti. The effect of doping on the conductivity is further evaluated and compared t pure boron carbide. The doped-B<sub>4</sub>C nanowires are expected to have improved physical properties with the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) predicted to be above 40 GPa based on our calculations, the highest value ever found in solids.</p>

    <p align="left" class="style6">Boron carbide thin films</p>
    <p align="left">Our research aims at understanding properties and capabilities of boron carbide-based materials for many potential applications such as hard coatings and ballistic impact shields. Although boron carbide possesses the highest dynamic elasticity among ceramic materials, it shows an anomalous glass-like behavior at high velocity impacts. The focus of our attention is to understand and adjust the mechanical response of boron carbide by investigating the chemistry, microstructure and morphology of boron carbide-based thin film.<br />
    Radio frequency magnetron sputtering is used for the deposition of boron carbide-based films. Electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and nano-indentation are performed for a full chemical, structural and mechanical characterization of the films.</p>
